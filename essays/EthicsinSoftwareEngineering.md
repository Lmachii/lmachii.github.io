## Ethics as a whole
Ethics are a very important part of software development because in most cases, computers are able to make the best decisions based on certain situations.  However it is up to us to decide which of those decisions are considered "best".  A great example of this would be the infamous trolley problem.  This problem is often used in ethic studies however when the object is an autonomous vehicle then it is up to the designers to decide what decision is "right".  

In the context of software engineering, ethics is the basis of how all software is designed.  That might sound like a bold statement but if you really think about it, it's true.  Someone who designs and creates a piece of software is usually creating it with their own ideals/ moral alignment.  This might not be apparent for a program that deals with numbers/ however higher level programs that must make choices will usually be made by the programmer or group of programmers.


## Case study: Autonomous Cars
As spoken about previously, autonomous cars are a major ethical dilemma in a programmers perspective.  The situation can be described as such:

If an autonomous car is driving down a road and it's brakes die and the vehicle is unable to stop, if that vehicle approaches a crosswalk with people crossing, should the car turn and hit a wall possibly killing the driver/passengers? Should it hit the people walking in the crosswalk saving the people in the vehicle?  What if the people walking in the crosswalk are walking without the crosswalk signaling them?  What if the people in the crosswalk are criminals?

The number of possibilities are almost limitless and it is up to the designers of the cars system to figure out what choice the car should make in that type of situation.  

## Conclusion
If I were the lead programmer for the autonomous car then I would put priority on keeping the passengers alive.  This is because I feel that it is the vehicle's responsibility to keep it's passengers save.  If the situation occurred where it hit people walking in a crosswalk then I would view that as an extreme situation and one that, if the vehicle is properly maintained, should not happen.
