## Does it matter?
Most of the time people would consider coding style to only matter in different environments to make code readable to people who would be reading it.  However I would argue that coding style is the single most important way of learning and memorizing a different language.  This is because when coding with a new language there will always be a moment where a programmer will think, "I could do this so easily in X language instead of this one".  Therefore I believe that if a programmer learns a language in a similar coding style, they will be able to transfer over similar knowledge.  In short, yes I believe that coding standards matter when learning a new language and judging by the past languages being created, it is safe to assume that there will be many more languages to learn.

## IntelliJ and ESlint
After working with the new development environment IntelliJ using ESlint, my impressions are sadly not good ones.  I feel that intelliJ is a somewhat roundabout IDE.  It never seems to save my settings and for every project I create I need to do the repeditive process of ensuring that ESlint is running as well as some other features.  While none of these checks are necessarily difficult, they are somewhat tedious and frankly annoying.  However despite my gripes, I enjoy using IntelliJ with ESlint and feel that the level of customization is very nice.  Getting the green check from ESlint is really not that difficult especially since there is an option to "fix" all the issues in the IDE itself.

To summarize, coding standards are there for readability and if a programmer cannot even read his/her own code easily, then coding standards should help said programmer in their endeavors.
