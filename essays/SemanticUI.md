## What is Semantic UI?
Semantic UI is a framework designed for HTML and CSS files.  It utilizes the simplicity of HTML and CSS coding with some pre-loaded formatting.  Semantic UI is capable of creating beautiful and user friendly web pages with only simple HTML knowledge required.  There are formatting presets such as columns, menus, images, and much more.  While semantic UI is somewhat limited to what it can do, semantic ui remains an extremely useful tool for webdevelopers alike.

## Why Use Semantic UI?
The biggest question that many web developers ask when given semantic UI is why to use it?  An experienced HTML developer could easily create the same if not better website with his/her own knowledge.  In some cases semantic UI actually hinders the environment.  Semantic UI is an awesome framework when a developer wants to create a clean and simple website.  However there are some issues with semantic UI that have deferred many people.  While semantic UI is very friendly, it can also be extremely stubborn.  What I mean by this is that there is a severe lack of documentation of the different types of containers available in semantic UI.  A developer might want to format images and text in a certain way and because of the way semantic UI is structured, there may be many issues or simply not achievable.  Many of these issues can be most likely resolved with some extensive practice with semantic UI.

## Would I use it?
After working with semantic UI and HTML separately and together, I personally think that semantic UI is a wonderful framework to use.  I realize that my frustration now with semantic UI can easily be cleared with some practice.  I have not used any other frameworks before so I cannot easily compare semantic UI to other ones.  However, I do feel that my experience with semantic UI will help me when I attempt to learn other types of frameworks.  

If I were to learn a new framework, I would want to learn Bootstrap or even Foundation.  The reason being that both of these other frameworks are used extensively across the world.
