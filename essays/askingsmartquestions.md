## The Good
  A good question can be defined as a question that invokes intellectual thought.  It is a query that cannot be answered simply be looking up a manual or tutorial.  These types of questions are often well detailed and documented showing previous attempts and what is known to not work.  This does not mean, however, that a good question is a question about something entirely new to the world.  These types of questions are simply put difficult situations for a poster and they have exhausted all of their known resources.  An example of this would be this [question] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2017381/is-it-possible-to-have-an-actual-memory-leak-in-python-because-of-your-code).  I personally feel that this is a smart question because it is not something that is entirely obvious to a user of the language especially to someone who does not view it as an issue at first.  However to a person who is planning on using the language for a commercial program, this becomes a serious risk.  This is also a good question, according to Eric Raymond, because it follows the guidelines of what a good question is.  It is in a relative forum website.  It's a very difficult question for someone who is starting to use the language and does not understand exactly how it works.  It is only posted on stack overflow as the poster most likely felt no need to post it in other places. And it is kept profession and has no personal emails linked anywhere. 

## The Bad
  Most often in school we are normally told that there are no dumb questions.  However In the world of computer science there may not be dumb questions, however there can be poorly asked questions.  An example of a poorly asked question is [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51678908/javascripts-push-doesnt-work).  This question states the issue of not being able to execute a javascript program.  However according to Eric Raymond, this is a "dumb" question.  The reason that this is a dumb questions is because this type of question most likely could have been answered through a little research on Google on the syntax of javascript. Most likely the user is doing this for one of two reasons, either the user is writing this for his/her own website or the user is doing it for work/school.  Both situations the user should have some type of resource that they are basing this off of and if not, the user is clearly just not trying hard enough to find the answer before resulting in asking for help.

## Why does it matter?
  It's very important, as not only a computer scientist but as a person with the desire to learn more, to ask good questions.  In school I was usually told "ask 3 before me" and I feel that the same rule applies when asking questions online.  If somebody doesn't want to put the effort into solving an issue before asking for it, why should somebody else have to do that for them?  I think that it comes down to how motivated and serious they are about truly learning the material.
