## The Beginning
Being my first experience with javascript, I find it extremely pleasent and very easy to use.  I have a decent amount of experience with java and C and find that many of my skills using those languages transfer over.  Javascript, however, is my first scripting language and web developing language as well.  The codecamp was an excellent tool to get more comfortable with javascript however I did feel that some of the exercises were a bit redundant the javascript section of the camp was fairly long.

## The good, bad, and ugly
At first glance, Javascript seems like a great language to learn with almost identical functions from java and C and very similar sytax as well.  However the fact that it is so lenient with some things (ie. using const, let, and var for variables instead of int, char, etc.) makes understanding exactly how the bits are manipulated very frustrating at first.  I feel that this uncertainty will wane over time similar to understanding previous languages.  Overall as a software engineering language, javascript is a wonderful tool to use and It's popularity in various commercial websites proves that point.

## Athletic Software Engineering
The activities we did in class (the practice and actual WODs) were very well thoughtout and excellent practices as a programmer.  This is because having a time limit as well as surprising and different questions truly tests a programmers knowledge of computer science as a whole.  The amount of stress induced by a WOD is enough to practice for it but not feel the "make or break" feeling.  I can see myself enjoying the rest of the semester doing both the in class WODs as well as the BWODs with Brandon.  I look forward to learning as much as I can in this class!
