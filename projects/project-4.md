The purpose of this project was simply the desire to create a steering wheel pedal combo for a much lower cost than commercial products.  The basis of this project uses an arduino nano.  I have used various libraries such as the controller library as well as a specific steering wheel library.  

For the circuit I tried not to make it too complicated using potentiometers for the pedals and a DC motor/encoder combo for the wheel itself.  The design of the entire thing requires a lot of TLC however it was operational and I was able to use it for various racing simulation games.

The next goal for this project would be to create a manual stick shifter.
